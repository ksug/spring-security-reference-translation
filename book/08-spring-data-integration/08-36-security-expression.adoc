== Security Expressions within @Query

Now Spring Security can be used within your queries.
For example:

[source,java]
----
@Repository
public interface MessageRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository<Message,Long> {
	@Query("select m from Message m where m.to.id = ?#{ principal?.id }")
	Page<Message> findInbox(Pageable pageable);
}
----

This checks to see if the `Authentication.getPrincipal().getId()` is equal to the recipient of the `Message`.
Note that this example assumes you have customized the principal to be an Object that has an id property.
By exposing the `SecurityEvaluationContextExtension` bean, all of the <<common-expressions,Common Security Expressions>> are available within the Query.
