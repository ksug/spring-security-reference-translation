= Authorization
The advanced authorization capabilities within Spring Security represent one of the most compelling reasons for its popularity. Irrespective of how you choose to authenticate - whether using a Spring Security-provided mechanism and provider, or integrating with a container or other non-Spring Security authentication authority - you will find the authorization services can be used within your application in a consistent and simple way.

In this part we'll explore the different `AbstractSecurityInterceptor` implementations, which were introduced in Part I. We then move on to explore how to fine-tune authorization through use of domain access control lists.
