== Spring Security Dependencies
This appendix provides a reference of the modules in Spring Security and the additional dependencies that they require in order to function in a running application. We don't include dependenices that are only used when building or testing Spring Security itself. Nor do we include transitive dependencies which are required by external dependencies.

The version of Spring required is listed on the project website, so the specific versions are omitted for Spring dependencies below. Note that some of the dependencies listed as"optional" below may still be required for other non-security functionality in a Spring application. Also dependencies listed as "optional" may not actually be marked as such in the project's Maven pom files if they are used in most applications. They are"optional" only in the sense that you don't need them unless you are using the specified functionality.

Where a module depends on another Spring Security module, the non-optional dependencies of the module it depends on are also assumed to be required and are not listed separately.
